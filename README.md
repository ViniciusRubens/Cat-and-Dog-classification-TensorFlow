CAT AND DOG CLASSIFICATION WITH TENSORFLOW

My project is based on the development of a machine learning using the concepts of Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow Framework.

Nos estudos de Deep Learning √© visto que determinadas camadas s√£o respons√°veis por determinados padr√µes de reconhecimento, como bordas, texturas, e asism por diante. 

O conceito da Convolutional Neural Netowork est√° baseado na an√°lise da nossa suposta imagem, e a partir dos valores de pixels presentes nessa imagem, possamos utilizar filtros, tamb√©m chamados de Kernel, que ir√£o executar a opera√ß√µes Convilucionais para obtermos outros valores em uma matriz de tamanho menor, e assim reconhecermos os padr√µes necess√°rios de cada camada.

Nos projetos de CONVNets √© muito comum a utiliza√ß√£o de camadas POOL, chamada Pooling Layers, usadas como forma de acelerar nossos c√°lculos e tornar algumas caracter√≠sticas mais robustas

Moreover, it is important to note that this project is a Deep Neural Network model for study and knowledge of how machine learning works for simple situations, without using mechanisms and frameworks, which would have a more significant efficiency, but which is not the goal in this work. This can be seen, by the uses of various functions of calculations such as RELU and Sigmoid (Activation Function for Output Layer), Cost Function, Forward Propagation and Backward Propagation.

Thanks, and enjoy.

## Features
[//]: # (Add the features of your project here:)
The programming language used was Python 3 in Jupyter environment, using the libraries highlighted below whose documentation is in the links just by clicking on them. In the next topic you will have a description of how you can install the libraries and test the code.

- üìÅ [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) ‚Äî Python library used for the calculations of multidimensional matrices.
- üìÅ [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/contents.html) ‚Äî Library used to check the tests.
- üìÅ [Os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) ‚Äî Library used to browse directories from our PC.
- üìÅ [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) ‚Äî Library used to generate pseudo-random numbers.
- üìÅ [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) ‚Äî Library used to modify and load our images.

## Getting started

To use this project, we need to do some library installations. Let's see below how to do this step:

üëâ To install the Numpy library, if we use the Windows Command Prompt we can run the command:

`pip install numpy`

If you want to install directly by Jupyter through Conda, we can execute the command:

`conda install numpy`

If you are having problems during installation, a good alternative is to check your version of pip and Python, when we run the command below in the Command Prompt both information are provided: 

`pip --version`

üëâ To install the Matplotlib library, the process is similar. By Command Prompt we will do: 

`pip install matplotlib`

üëâ By default the Os library is a package already installed together with the Python installation.

üëâ By default the random library is a package already installed together with the Python installation.

üëâ Finally, the OpenCV library can be installed through the following command in the Command Prompt:

`pip install opencv-python`

‚ö†Ô∏è This project works with a database of images available free of charge on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) platform . In this project the volume of images was reduced due to the hardware limitations of the computer that performed the training.
